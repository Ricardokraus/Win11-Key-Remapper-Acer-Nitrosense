# Development notes

Technical notes for contributors: how the app is built, why, and the traps this
project already fell into. Read this before changing the hook or the toast.

## Everyday commands

```powershell
# Syntax check without running
AutoHotkey64.exe /ErrorStdOut /Validate src\Win11KeyRemapper.ahk

# Logic tests: no hook is installed, no keys are sent, nothing is shown
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\run-tests.ps1

# Run it. If a copy is already running, this one just asks it to open its
# settings and exits; use tray → Restart instead.
AutoHotkey64.exe src\Win11KeyRemapper.ahk

# Regenerate the icon (add -Preview preview.png to see every size)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\make-icon.ps1

# Build dist\Win11KeyRemapper.exe (downloads AutoHotkey + Ahk2Exe once into a
# cache). Only for working on the exe: it isn't published (see "The exe").
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build.ps1
```

When you run from source, `settings.ini` is created in `src\` (gitignored).

The tests patch the app before running it: startup (`Main()`) is removed, the
settings window is created hidden and `SendInput`, `Run`, `Download`,
`Set*LockState`, `GlassToast` and `MsgBox` are replaced by stubs. `run-tests.ps1`
refuses to run if one of those patches no longer applies, so renaming those calls
means updating the patch list too.

## How the hook works

A single `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook (`KeyboardProc`). For every event:

1. `nCode != 0` → pass. Read `vk`, `sc | ((flags & 1) << 8)` (scan code with the
   extended bit, as shown in AutoHotkey's Key History), `flags`.
2. **Injected** (`flags & 0x10`) → pass. That's our own `SendInput` and lock-key
   toggles; without this a remap could loop.
3. **Swallowed key-ups**: the key-up (and auto-repeats) of a key whose key-down we
   ate is eaten too, otherwise Windows would get an unpaired key-up. Entries go
   stale after `REPEAT_MS` without events, so a missed key-up can't eat a later,
   normal key press.
4. **Detection mode** (settings window listening) → handled by `CaptureKey`.
5. **Modifiers** are tracked in `HELD` by the hook itself (see hardware facts).
   The fake Left Ctrl that AltGr sends (scan code `0x21D`) is ignored.
6. **Paused** → pass.
7. **Keys already being handled** (`PRESS`): a key-up ends the press; a key-down
   within `REPEAT_MS` of the previous one is auto-repeat.
8. **Launcher**: key matches `LaunchVK/SC` and the held modifiers are exactly the
   required set (`LaunchModsHeld` first drops modifiers that `GetKeyState(…, "P")`
   says are up — missed key-ups).
9. **Remap**: key matches the source (`MatchSC` decides whether the scan code must
   match). Always swallowed, so Windows and the vendor software never see it.
10. Otherwise pass.

Rules:

- **Nothing heavy inside the hook.** Actions are pushed to `QUEUE` and run by
  `RunQueue` on a `SetTimer(…, -1)`, which keeps their order. GUI updates from the
  detector also go through a timer (`CaptureDone`).
- **Windows silently removes a low-level hook that doesn't answer in time**
  (`LowLevelHooksTimeout`), and nothing tells the app. AutoHotkey is single
  threaded, so anything slow on the main thread (the Apps-folder lookup, `Run`)
  can cause it. `HookInstall()` creates a new hook before removing the old one and
  is called after those operations, after unlocking, when the display turns on
  and after resuming from sleep.
- `REPEAT_MS` is 1500 ms: it must be longer than the slowest Windows repeat delay
  (1 s). With 500 ms the first auto-repeat could arrive after the window and
  toggle Num Lock a second time.
- `Mode=Key` without modifiers is a real remap (`{Blind}{vkXXscYYY down}` /
  `up`), so holding repeats and Shift+source gives Shift+target. Except for a
  lock key (Num, Caps, Scroll Lock: `RT.noRepeat`), whose auto-repeat is eaten so
  holding toggles it once. With modifiers, the whole combo is sent on every
  key-down. There used to be separate "toggle Num/Caps/Scroll Lock" modes; they
  were the same thing with more options to choose from, so they're gone, and
  `LoadSettings` turns an old `Mode=NumLock` into `Mode=Key` with Num Lock.
- Changing settings or pausing while a key is held calls `ReleasePresses()`: it
  sends the key-up of a held target key and marks the physical key-up to be eaten.

### Key detector

- Modifier key-down → remembered and swallowed.
- Non-modifier key-down → finishes with the held modifiers (ignored for the key to
  remap).
- Modifier key-up with nothing else pressed → that modifier is the key, so keys
  like Right Ctrl can be remapped.
- Key-ups of keys pressed *before* listening started are let through (e.g. the
  Enter that clicked the button).
- On finish or cancel, every key still held is added to the swallow list.
- It runs before the rules and even while paused, so the NitroSense key itself can
  be detected. 10 s timeout; clicking the button again cancels.

## The settings window

- **Layout**: Windows 11 Settings style. A sidebar with sections (`PAGES`), a page
  title, and setting cards: each row has a title, an optional description (also
  used for the current value, e.g. a key's codes, or for what's missing, in red)
  and the control on the right. `SL` holds the layout in logical pixels.
- **Changes apply at once** (`CommitDraft`): the window edits `DRAFT`; each change
  is validated and, if complete, copied to `CFG`, saved and applied. If something
  blocks it (e.g. *Press another key* without a key), the row says so and the
  previous settings stay active. Restart and Exit are red buttons in *General*
  (no confirmation); Reset in *Advanced* asks first, because it loses settings.
- **Drawing**: standard Win32 controls can't draw rounded cards, buttons with
  states, keycaps, switches or the sidebar, so those are GDI+ bitmaps (reusing the
  toast library's helpers). The cards of the current section are one bitmap
  painted on `WM_ERASEBKGND`. Everything clickable is a **widget** (`UiWidget`):
  a Picture control (`SS_BITMAP | SS_NOTIFY`) redrawn by `RenderWidget` for each
  state: buttons (normal, `danger`, `accent`), switches, sidebar entries, keycap
  views, the About card and its link rows. Only drop-down lists are native.
  Bitmaps are opaque (drawn on their background color), so ClearType works.
  Icons come from *Segoe Fluent Icons* (Windows 11) or *Segoe MDL2 Assets*
  (Windows 10).
- **Widgets and the mouse**: `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` on a widget presses it and captures
  the mouse; `WM_LBUTTONUP` releases it and runs its action only if the mouse is
  still over it (`InClient`), from a timer, not inside the message handler, like
  a real button. `WM_MOUSEMOVE` sets the hovered widget (`SetHot`), and a 50 ms
  timer (`CheckHot`) notices when the mouse left the window or a press got lost.
  `WM_SETCURSOR` reaches the window for its child controls: it returns the hand
  cursor for enabled widgets, lists and ⓘ icons. A widget's bitmap is set with
  `STM_SETIMAGE` directly (3x faster than `.Value`); the static control keeps its
  own copy of a bitmap with alpha, so whatever isn't in use is freed (`Draw`,
  `Free`).
- **Animations**: a widget animates its `pos` (`Animate`, `AnimTick`, ease-out
  with overshoot): a switch's knob slides (and the color fades), the selected
  section's accent bar grows in. Buttons have a darker "lip" and sink onto it while
  pressed; keycaps too; the switch knob grows on hover and stretches while pressed.
  A frame costs under 1 ms. Skipped when Windows' animation effects are off
  (`SPI_GETCLIENTAREAANIMATION`).
- **No flicker, no cut**: changing many controls at once (switching sections, a
  DPI change, the *Sends* row appearing) happens inside `Freeze()`, which stops
  painting with `WM_SETREDRAW`. Then `Flip()` composes the whole client area
  off-screen (`ComposeWindow`: the background bitmap, then each visible control
  printed with `WM_PRINT` into a bitmap of its own and copied to its place),
  turns painting back on, copies the image in one `BitBlt`, validates
  everything so nothing repaints piece by piece, and lets the drop-down lists
  repaint themselves (they don't print their text). Repainting control by
  control on screen (`RedrawWindow`) let DWM show half-painted frames at 180 Hz:
  a visible "cut". `PrintWindow` isn't used: it clips to the window's current
  size.
- **Moving to a monitor with another scale** (`OnSettingsDpiChanged`): laying
  everything out again takes ~45 ms, which stalled the window in the middle of
  the drag. Like Chromium, the window takes the new size at once showing its
  current picture scaled (`StretchToNewSize`; the picture is composed with
  `ComposeWindow`, because reading it from the window while it moves between
  monitors gave a broken mix), and the real layout is done when
  the drag ends (`WM_EXITSIZEMOVE` → `ApplyPendingDpi` → `Flip`), or right away
  if the window wasn't dragged. Meanwhile the controls are hidden and the window
  paints the scaled picture as its background (`OnSettingsErase`): Windows makes
  every control repaint after a DPI change, and they did it at their old places
  on top of the picture. `SWP_NOCOPYBITS`, or Windows copies the old pixels back
  over the scaled picture. Hover and animations wait meanwhile. The monitors
  don't line up, so part of the window can be outside every screen while it
  crosses: on every `WM_MOVE` the scaled picture is invalidated again, so no
  stale pixels show when that part comes back. `WS_EX_COMPOSITED` was not used:
  it fights DWM and makes child windows sluggish ([Raymond
  Chen](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171018-00/?p=97245)).
  Only while the window is visible: `WM_SETREDRAW` on a hidden window would show
  it. Controls of the other sections
  are created hidden, and a hidden widget is only marked `dirty` and drawn when its
  section is shown. Text colors go through `SetColor`, which remembers them, so a
  DPI change can re-apply fonts without losing the color.
- **Per-monitor DPI**: the app is system-DPI-aware, so on a monitor with another
  scale Windows stretched the window (blurry) and misplaced the menus. The
  settings window is created in a **Per-Monitor v2** thread context with
  `-DPIScale`; every control goes through `Place()`, which scales positions
  (`Px`) and font sizes (`FontPts`: AutoHotkey sizes fonts for the main
  monitor's DPI, so points are converted) and remembers the control. On
  `WM_DPICHANGED` (`OnSettingsDpiChanged`) only the sidebar and the visible
  section are laid out again (`LayoutPage`, one `DeferWindowPos` batch); the other
  sections when they're shown (`UI.laidOut`). Then the window takes the size
  Windows suggests and is painted once. Measured: ~150 ms down to ~40 ms; switching
  sections ~55 ms with flicker down to ~20 ms in one paint. A `WM_DPICHANGED` for
  the DPI the window already uses (it's created on the main monitor, then shown on
  another) is ignored, or the window would shrink. The tray menu and the ⓘ
  tooltips are shown with the thread temporarily in PMv2 (`PMv2()`), at physical
  coordinates.
- **Reading positions**: a system-aware thread asking for the position of a PMv2
  window gets coordinates "virtualized" for its own DPI. Always switch to PMv2
  (`PMv2()`) before `WinGetPos`/`GetPos` on the settings window.
- **Light/dark**: `Theme=System` reads `AppsUseLightTheme`. Dark mode uses the
  undocumented but widely used uxtheme exports (ordinals 133
  `AllowDarkModeForWindow`, 135 `SetPreferredAppMode`, 136 `FlushMenuThemes`) for
  the menus and drop-down lists (`SetWindowTheme` with `DarkMode_CFD`),
  `WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX` for open lists, and `DwmSetWindowAttribute` 20 (dark title
  bar) / 35 (caption color, Windows 11). Widgets use the colors in `THEMES`. When
  the theme changes, the window is rebuilt in place.
- Widgets are clickable but not reachable with Tab; lists and Esc work as usual.

## One copy at a time, restart, hidden tray icon

- `#SingleInstance Off`: at startup the app looks for a hidden AutoHotkey main
  window titled `Win11KeyRemapper.Instance` (it renames its own). If another copy
  exists, it posts it a registered message ("open your settings") and exits. That
  is how users reach the settings when the tray icon is hidden, and it also stops
  a source copy and an exe copy from running two hooks.
- *Restart* (and an update) starts the app again with `--restart <old pid>`: the
  new copy waits for the old one to exit before installing its hook, and skips the
  "already running" check.

## Updates

- `CheckUpdates()` asks `api.github.com/repos/.../releases/latest` with
  `WinHttp.WinHttpRequest` in **async** mode and polls it with a timer: a blocking
  request would stall the keyboard hook. Automatic checks run 1 minute after
  startup and then every 24 h (`CheckUpdates=1`).
- The JSON is read with three regexes (`tag_name`, the release `html_url`, the
  `browser_download_url` of the zip and of `SHA256SUMS.txt`). Version comparison
  is numeric (`VersionNewer`).
- From source (how the app is published now) the button is *Download*: it opens
  the release page, and the user extracts the new zip over the old folder.
- *Install* (compiled exe in a writable folder only; dormant while no exe is
  published, see "The exe"): `Download()` the zip and
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` (blocking, but the user asked for it; the hook is reinstalled
  right after), check the zip's SHA-256 (`BCryptHash`), unzip with
  `Shell.Application`, check the new exe's SHA-256, rename the running exe to
  `.old` (Windows allows renaming a running exe), copy the new one in place,
  start it with `--restart <pid> --updated` and exit. The next start deletes the
  `.old` file. From source, or if anything fails, the release page opens instead.
- The release assets' names are part of this contract: `Win11KeyRemapper-v*.zip`
  and `SHA256SUMS.txt`. *Install* also needs `Win11KeyRemapper.exe` inside the
  zip and in the sums; today's zips hold the script (`src\`, `assets\icon.ico`),
  so an old exe copy that finds one sends the user to the release page.

## Notifications

- **System notifications** (`SystemToast`): updates found by the daily check,
  pause/resume from the tray, the startup/unlock one (`StatusToast`).
  `ToastWhen=Never` turns them all off except warnings (`kind = "warn"`), which
  need the user (e.g. *App not found* after the NitroSense shortcut).
- **Notices inside the settings window** (`Notice`): whatever the user just did
  there: "*Theme: Dark* · Saved", the answer of *Check now*, errors. A separate
  component on purpose, not a mode of `GlassToast`: its own small window, state
  (`NT`) and timer, so a notice and a notification never replace each other and
  the notifications setting can't leak into it. A small solid pill (40 px high)
  in the window's colors, drawn once, at the bottom center of the window, rising
  a little while fading in; click-through (`WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`), so it can't be
  clicked away; owned by the window, so it stays above it and closes with it;
  `WM_MOVE` → `NoticeFollow` keeps it in place. With the window closed, a notice
  becomes a system notification (and follows `ToastWhen`).
- Message boxes (Reset, install an update) are created in a PMv2 thread context
  (`Dialog`), or Windows stretches them on a monitor with another scale (blurry).
- *Restart* from the settings window starts the new copy with
  `--settings <section> <x> <y>`: it reopens the window where it was.


`GTCFG.position` (`TopCenter`, `TopRight`, `TopLeft`, `BottomCenter`,
`BottomRight`, `BottomLeft`) and `GTCFG.animation` (`Slide`, `Fade`, `None`) are
and `GTCFG.glass` (`ToastTransparency`) are read when each toast is built. Without
glass the card is solid, in the settings window's colors (`GTCFG.solidTheme`:
the app's theme, or Windows' app mode for *System*), and nothing is captured.
`GT_Placement` computes the resting position and
where the toast comes from: *Slide* enters from the top edge (top center), rises a
little (bottom center, so it doesn't cross the taskbar), or comes in from the side
(left/right positions); *Fade* and *None* stay in place. The glass capture is
clamped to the monitor. The settings window's test button builds a toast with the
draft's style and restores `GTCFG` afterwards.

## Hard-won facts about the hardware (Acer Nitro V 16S AI, ANV16S-41)

- The NitroSense key reports **VK `0xFF`, SC `0x175`**. Other Acer keys share
  VK `0xFF`: **Win Lock on (Fn+Win) = SC `0x159`**, **Win Lock off = SC `0x162`**.
  Matching by VK only made Win Lock toggle Num Lock. Hence `MatchSC=1`.
- In early tests the key seemed to report SC `0x145` sometimes. That was almost
  certainly the Num Lock key (`VK 90 SC 145`) injected by the script itself.
- AutoHotkey hotkeys on the raw scan code (`$sc175::`) gave double toggles and are
  fragile → the DllCall hook.
- Returning `1` for the key is required: if Acer's software also handles it, Num
  Lock toggles twice.
- `GetKeyState()` for Ctrl/Alt is unreliable while an elevated window (Task
  Manager) has the focus (UIPI), in both logical and physical mode → modifiers are
  tracked in the hook. Even so, a non-elevated hook simply doesn't receive keys
  while an elevated window is focused. **Accepted limitation.** Do not add
  self-elevation or a "run with highest privileges" scheduled task: self-elevation
  broke autostart because the UAC prompt can't be answered at logon.
- Acer Quick Access (`QAAdmin`) shows its own Caps/Num Lock overlay. NitroSense
  needs Quick Access, so it can't be removed. Out of scope.
- **Autostart:** a shortcut in `shell:startup` pointing to the `.ahk` did **not**
  start at logon (the `.ahk` association isn't ready yet). The shortcut must run
  `AutoHotkey64.exe "script.ahk"`, or the compiled exe. `SetAutostart()` does that
  and recreates the shortcut on every launch, in case the app was moved.
- NitroSense's desktop install lives in
  `%ProgramFiles%\NitroSense\Prerequisites\NitroSenseLauncher.exe` on the test
  laptop. The Store version is found through `shell:AppsFolder`.

## AutoHotkey v2 pitfalls already hit here

1. **Variable names are case-insensitive.** `S` (DPI scale) and `s` (a parameter)
   were the same variable, so the toast icon was scaled by the DPI and overflowed.
   Never use pairs like `S/s`, `W/w`, `H/h`, `B/b`, `R/r` in one function — and
   don't name a local like a global (`held` *is* `HELD`).
2. **Reserved words** can't be variables: `is`, `in`, `and`, `or`, `not`,
   `contains`, `super`, `unset`, `this`.
3. **`DllCall("lib\Func")` unloads the DLL after the call if it wasn't loaded.**
   Handles from `pdh`, `winmm` (`timeBeginPeriod`), `wtsapi32` and `gdiplus` broke
   until `DllCall("LoadLibrary", …)` was added at startup.
4. **Timers can interrupt other threads between lines.** Use `Critical` in hook
   callbacks and animation steps; when swapping resources (like the hook), create
   the new one before freeing the old one.
5. **No heavy or GUI work inside the low-level hook** (see above).
6. **Closures capturing loop variables / nested closures** didn't fire reliably for
   the old Gui toast → toast state lives in a global object (`GT`).
7. **Default parameter values must be literals** in v2.0 (`mods := []` is a syntax
   error; use `0` and replace it inside).
8. **DPI:** the app is system-DPI-aware. The toast switches the thread to
   Per-Monitor v2 (`SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext(-4)`) only while building and
   animating, then restores it; otherwise the screen capture on a monitor with a
   different scale came out black. Don't make the whole thread PMv2: the settings
   window would break on the second monitor.
9. In Git Bash, `/ErrorStdOut` and `/Validate` get converted to paths
   (`C:/Program Files/Git/ErrorStdOut`). Call AutoHotkey from PowerShell or cmd.
10. **`switch` is a keyword**: a function can't be called `Switch()`.
11. **`try` without braces inside `if … else`** makes `else` attach to the `try`
    ("Unexpected Else"). Use braces.
12. **COM booleans are -1** (`VARIANT_TRUE`): don't use -1 as an error marker for
    a COM call's result.
13. **A parameter can't share a global's name, in any case**: `SetPaused(paused)`
    with `global PAUSED` is a load error.
14. **Picture controls**: `*w32 *h32 file` only works when *changing* the image
    (`.Value`); when creating it, put the size in the options. `SetFont` isn't
    supported on pictures.
15. **PowerShell `Start-Process -PassThru`**: read `.Handle` right away and call
    `WaitForExit()` without a timeout at the end, or `ExitCode` stays empty.
16. **Tests must never show a dialog**: `tests.ahk` sets `OnError` to print the
    error and exit, and `run-tests.ps1` kills the run after 90 s. Never start
    `AutoHotkey64.exe` without a script either: it shows "Script file not found".
17. **Checking what's really on screen**: an off-screen window (x -32000) has an
    empty clip region, so nothing drawn into its DC lands anywhere, and
    `PrintWindow` re-renders the window instead of returning what's shown. To
    test drawing code, show the window on screen but cloaked
    (`DwmSetWindowAttribute` 13) and read its surface with `BitBlt` from
    `GetDCEx(hwnd, 0, DCX_CACHE)`.
18. **Functions and variables share one namespace**: a local named like a function
    (`animate` next to an `Animate()` function) hides it in that function. Same for
    globals at the top level of a script (`links` *is* `LINKS`).

## The glass toast

Design (user preferences): rounded card, not a pill; concentric icon tile (icon
radius = card radius − margin); glass = blurred capture of what's behind
(blur 60, saturation 1.3) with a tint per theme; light/dark theme from the
background's luminance (the light theme uses softer colors). By default it slides
down from the top center of the monitor under the mouse with a small overshoot,
holds, and slides up while fading; position and animation are configurable (see
*Notifications* above). Click dismisses it with the same animation.

Shown at startup, on session unlock (`WTS_SESSION_UNLOCK`) and when the display
turns back on without a password (`GUID_CONSOLE_DISPLAY_STATE` 0 → 1, only if the
session isn't locked, so it never shows twice). Hidden on lock / display off.

Performance (measured with a telemetry build before optimizing):

- The cost came from redrawing the shadow every frame, blurring at full
  resolution, and recomposing/re-uploading the bitmap every frame.
- Now it draws **once**, frees every GDI+ object (and calls `GdiplusShutdown`),
  then only moves/fades the layered window with `UpdateLayeredWindow` **without a
  bitmap** (`hdcSrc = NULL`). dwm.exe GPU use went back to idle.
- AutoHotkey timers can't go below ~15.6 ms even with `timeBeginPeriod(1)` → about
  60 fps. A custom loop was rejected (risky next to the hook). `timeBeginPeriod`
  is only active while animating.
- A "live" glass (recapturing every 40 ms) was tried and rejected: choppy at
  180 Hz and +13 % CPU.

## Things tried and rejected

- Hotkeys on the scan code (`$sc145::`, `$sc175::`) with `Send "{NumLock}"`:
  double toggles, fragile.
- Self-elevation at startup: broke autostart (UAC at logon).
- Matching only VK `0xFF`: caught Win Lock.
- A separate key-probe tool: annoying and filled the screen → the detector lives
  in the settings window.
- No auto-repeat filter: holding the key toggled many times.

## Manual test checklist

The tests cover the logic; this needs real keys:

- [ ] NitroSense key → Num Lock toggles once per press, also when held; Caps Lock too.
- [ ] Win Lock (Fn+Win) still works and doesn't touch Num Lock.
- [ ] Right Ctrl + NitroSense key opens NitroSense; Left Ctrl + key toggles Num Lock.
- [ ] *Change…* captures a single key, a combo, and a lone modifier (Right Ctrl);
  Right Ctrl + Num Lock is captured as that, not as Pause.
- [ ] *Action*: *Do nothing* / *Keep its normal behavior* hide the *Sends* row.
- [ ] `Mode=Key`: holding the key repeats the target; Shift+key gives Shift+target.
- [ ] Changes apply at once without restarting; incomplete ones (no key to send) show a red hint.
- [ ] Every section of the settings window; changes apply at once; the ⓘ tooltips.
- [ ] Switching sections doesn't flicker; the accent bar grows in.
- [ ] Hover and press: buttons sink onto their lip, switches slide, the hand cursor
  shows over everything clickable; releasing outside a button does nothing.
- [ ] Move the settings window to the other monitor and back while dragging: it
  follows the mouse without stalling, shows a scaled picture (never a mix of
  old and new) and gets sharp, with everything in place, when dropped.
- [ ] Tray menu (Settings, Pause, Restart, Exit) on each monitor: opens at the icon, at the right size.
- [ ] Every change in the settings window shows a notice inside it, from the
  bottom; clicking it does nothing; it moves with the window. With *Show
  notifications* = *Never*, nothing appears on the desktop (only warnings).
- [ ] *Restart* from the settings window reopens it in the same section and place.
- [ ] Reset's question and *Browse…* are sharp on the 125 % monitor.
- [ ] *General*: *Restart* and *Exit* (red, no confirmation); *About*: the card
  opens the GitHub page, the rows open the FAQ and the issue forms.
- [ ] Light, dark and *System* themes; switching Windows' mode with the window open.
- [ ] Every notification position and animation, with *Show a test*; *Show notifications*:
  Always / Only when the app starts / Never (lock and unlock to check);
  *Transparency effects* off: a solid card, light or dark like the window.
- [ ] Pause / resume and *Restart* from the tray.
- [ ] Hide the tray icon, open the app again: the settings appear; turn it back on.
- [ ] *Check now* (up to date / update available); *Download* opens the release page.
- [ ] Start with Windows: sign out and in, the app starts.
- [ ] Toast at startup, after unlock (Win+L) and after the display turns off/on.
- [ ] Toast on a second monitor with a different scale isn't black.
- [ ] Settings window on both monitors looks right.

## Releasing

1. Bump the version in `src/Win11KeyRemapper.ahk` (`APP.version` **and**
   `;@Ahk2Exe-SetVersion`, the workflow checks they match), and in
   `CHANGELOG.md` replace "Unreleased" with the date.
2. Commit, then tag and push: `git tag v0.5.1` and `git push origin v0.5.1`.
3. The workflow refuses a tag that doesn't match the version, checks, tests,
   zips `src\` + `assets\icon.ico` + README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG and
   `settings.example.ini`, creates the release as a draft with the zip,
   `SHA256SUMS.txt` and short install notes, and publishes it. Doing it in that
   order also works with immutable releases.
4. Running copies find the new version within a day (or with *Check now*) and
   *Download* opens the release page.

## The exe (pending)

v0.5.0 shipped a compiled `Win11KeyRemapper.exe` (Ahk2Exe: the AutoHotkey runtime
with the script embedded). It's no longer published: **Windows 11's Smart App
Control blocks unsigned exes it doesn't know**, with no *Run anyway* (unlike
SmartScreen), and the only way around it is turning Smart App Control off for
the whole PC. `AutoHotkey64.exe` is signed, so the script runs everywhere.

To bring an installable, self-updating exe back:

1. **Code signing.** SignPath Foundation signs open-source projects for free
   (apply, then sign in GitHub Actions); Azure Artifact Signing (formerly Trusted
   Signing) is a cheap paid option. Smart App Control lets signed apps run.
2. Put the compile step back in the workflow (see the workflow at tag `v0.5.0`:
   download Ahk2Exe, compile, VirusTotal scan with the optional `VT_API_KEY`
   secret), sign the exe, and add it to the zip and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
3. Optionally an installer (Inno Setup, per user in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`, no
   admin, so the in-place update keeps working). It must be signed too, close the
   running copy first (post `WM_COMMAND 65307` to the `Win11KeyRemapper.Instance`
   window) and remove the startup shortcut and `settings.ini` on uninstall.
4. The app side is already there: `InstallUpdate()` replaces a compiled exe in
   place, `SetAutostart()` points the shortcut at the exe, and the icon comes
   from the exe's resources.

## Ideas for later

Multiple remap rules, Spanish UI (and README), a community model list.
