On Acer Nitro laptops the **NitroSense key** sits right next to Backspace and
Num Lock. One slip and the NitroSense app pops up. **Windows 11 Key Remapper**
is a tiny tray app that gives that key a better job — or any other key you pick.

<a name="installation"></a>
## 🚀 Get started

The app is an [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script. AutoHotkey is
free, open source and signed, so it also runs with Windows 11's *Smart App
Control* on. (There's no exe for now: [why?](docs/FAQ.md#why-no-exe))

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (*Download v2.0* → run
   the installer, default options).

2. Download `Win11KeyRemapper-vX.Y.Z.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Ricardokraus/Win11-Key-Remapper-Acer-Nitrosense/releases/latest)
   and extract it to a folder you'll keep, for example `Documents\Win11KeyRemapper`
   (not *Downloads*: *Start with Windows* points to wherever the app is).

3. Double-click **`src\Win11KeyRemapper.ahk`**.

4. The settings window opens on *Keys*. Pick what the NitroSense key should do —
   changes apply at once. *Start with Windows* is already on. Close the window:
   the app lives in the tray. Double-click its icon, or open the app again, to
   come back.

Everything is changed from the settings window. If you'd rather edit a text file,
`src\settings.ini` explains every option inside it (open it from *Settings* →
*Advanced* → *Open folder*), and [`settings.example.ini`](settings.example.ini)
shows them all with their defaults.

## ✨ Features

<details>
<summary><b>See all features</b></summary>
<br>

- **Remap the NitroSense key** (or any key) to another key or shortcut — **Num
  Lock** by default — or make it do nothing.

- **Holding it toggles Num Lock once** (or Caps / Scroll Lock), not over and
  over; other keys repeat like the real key.

- **Built-in key detector**: click *Change…*, press a key or a combination, done.

- **A shortcut to open NitroSense** (default: <kbd>Right Ctrl</kbd> + NitroSense
  key). It finds the app by itself, Microsoft Store version included, or opens any
  app you choose.

- **Windows 11 style settings**: a sidebar with sections, **light and dark
  mode**, changes applied at once, small animations, sharp on every monitor.

- **Notifications your way**: always (at startup, after unlocking, when the
  screen turns on), only at startup, or never; six positions, three animations,
  frosted glass or solid.

- **A tiny tray menu** (settings, pause, restart, exit), or **no tray icon** at
  all.

- **Tells you about new versions**: checks GitHub once a day (you can turn it
  off).

- **Light**: no admin rights, no driver, no service, no CPU use while idle.

- **Free and open source** (MIT).

## 🔄 Updating and uninstalling

<details>
<summary><b>How to update</b></summary>
<br>

When there's a new version, the app tells you (*Settings* → *Updates*), and
*Download* opens the release page. Then:

1. Click *Exit* in the app (settings → *General* → *App*, or tray icon → *Exit*).

2. Download the new zip and extract it **over the same folder**, replacing the
   files. Your `settings.ini` isn't in the zip, so it stays.

3. Double-click `src\Win11KeyRemapper.ahk` again.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How to uninstall</b></summary>
<br>

1. In the settings (*General*), turn off *Start with Windows*.

2. Click *Exit* under *App* (or tray icon → *Exit*).

3. Delete the app's folder, and `%APPDATA%\Win11KeyRemapper` if it exists.
   Nothing else is installed.

If you don't use AutoHotkey for anything else, you can uninstall it from
Windows' *Installed apps*.
